# Go State and Country Value Set Generator

A simple Go app used to generate state and country picklist value sets. Can be easily updated to include state, currently it's just Country.

Country values found in [@lukes](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes/blob/master/all/all.csv) repo.
